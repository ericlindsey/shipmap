# 🛳️ ShipMap - Live Research Vessel Tracker

This is a simple Flask + Leaflet web app to visualize live ship track data from the WHOI intranet server. It fetches the latest `.xy` file from the Atlantis map service, parses it, and displays:

- 🚢 Live-updating ship track (auto-refreshes every 5 min)
- 🟢 Current ship position marker
- 🌊 Optional bathymetry overlay (GEBCO 2023 WMS)
- 🌒 Day/night terminator overlay
- 🧭 Fully self-contained — runs locally with Python
